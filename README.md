# NHL Goal Prediction

## Predicting goals in event sequences using Kaggle NHL Game Data.

 The problem of predicting rare events in event sequences has numerous applications such as anticipating equipment failures or cyber attacks. The purpose of this analysis is to use a machine learning algorithm to monitor sequences of events and predict when goals will occur during National Hockey League (NHL) games.

 The [NHL Game Data](https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data?select=game_plays.csv) from Kaggle contains information about events that occur during NHL games such as type, time, team, and location. It spans 11244 games from the 2011-12 season to the 2017-18 season. 9000 games (about 80%) will be used to train the algorithm and the remainder to evaluate it.
